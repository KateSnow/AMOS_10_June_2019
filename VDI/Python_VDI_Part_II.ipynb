    "### Installing your own Python packages\n",
    "\n",
    "To install additional Python packages locally, the easiest way is using **pip**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First, make sure you have loaded Python. Then load the appropriate pip module (i.e., Python-3.5) . In this example, we are using Python 3.5.2: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    $ module load python3\n",
    "    $ module load pip/8.1.2-py3.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, use `pip install` followed by the Python package:\n",
    "In this simple example we are downloading a program for units called [Pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/). \n",
    "\n",
    "    $ pip install pint --user \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "<b>NOTE:</b> The flag '--user' is required so that the package is installed locally. If not included, permission errors will be returned.  \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let's test that Pint was installed correctly.** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start `iPython` from the command line: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    $ ipython\n",
    "    \n",
    "```   \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Enter the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    >>> from pint import UnitRegistry\n",
    "    >>> ureg = UnitRegistry()\n",
    "    >>> distance = 24.0 * ureg.meter\n",
    "    >>> print(distance)\n",
    "    >>> time = 8.0 * ureg.second\n",

    "### Python Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is it**?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's `virtualenv` is a tool that helps manage multiple Python projects by creating isolated environments for them. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use it**?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keeps your home space clean and manageable.\n",
    "- Isolate system dependencies.\n",
    "- Different environments can be defined for different projects or analysis workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - e.g., Project 1 requires NumPy  v1.10 but Project 2 has a dependency that needs NumPy v1.9)\n",
    "    - This is particularly helpful when some libraries conflict with each other for some workflows but not others.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- If something breaks or goes wrong within an environment, you can just delete the virtual environment directory and start again.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating a virtual environment** \n",
    "\n",
    "First, load python module\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ module load python3\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, make a home for your virtual environments and create the virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the environment using the `venv` command followed by a name: \n",
    "\n",
    "    $ python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>NOTE: </b> When using python2.7, you need to load a seperate virtual environment module \"virtualenv/15.0.2-py2.7(py2.7)\", then run \"virtualenv <virtual_environment>\". While the virtual enviornment module \"pyvenv\" is included in python3 packages, but it has been deprecated as of Python 3.6 in favor of using python3 -m venv to help prevent any potential confusion as to which Python interpreter a virtual environment will be based on. \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "    \n",
    "For example, if we called the environment \"my_python_env\" this step creates a folder named `my_python_env`. When first creating a new environment, it inherits the python module loaded into your path (e.g., python3/3.5.2 in this example) and installs a local version of ‘pip’. \n",
